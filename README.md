# Spyder + QDarkStyleSheet
I wanted to make spyder dark so it would match the rest of my themeing across my computer.
 - does it work? Only launching with the boostrap command.
 - requires QDarkStyle

## Overview

Spyder is a Python development environment with tons of features:
    
* Editor
    
    Multi-language editor with function/class browser, code analysis
    features (pyflakes and pylint are currently supported), code
    completion, horizontal and vertical splitting, and goto definition.

* Interactive console

    Python or IPython consoles with workspace and debugging support to
    instantly evaluate the code written in the Editor. It also comes
    with Matplotlib figures integration. 

* Documentation viewer

    Show documentation for any class or function call made either in the
    Editor or a Console.

* Variable explorer

    Explore variables created during the execution of a file. Editing
    them is also possible with several GUI based editors, like a
    dictionary and Numpy array ones.

* Find in files feature

    Supporting regular expressions and mercurial repositories

* File/directories explorer

* History log

Spyder may also be used as a PyQt4/PySide extension library (module 
`spyderlib`). For example, the Python interactive shell widget used in
Spyder may be embedded in your own PyQt4/PySide application.

## Running from source

The fastest way to run Spyder is to get the source code, install PyQt
or PySide, and run:

    python bootstrap.py

You may want to do this for fixing bugs in Spyder, adding new
features, learning how Spyder works or just getting a taste of it.

## Installation
    
This section explains how to install the latest stable release of 
Spyder. If you prefer testing the development version, please use 
the `bootstrap` script (see next section).

The easiest way to install Spyder is:
            
* On Windows:

    - Using one of our executable installers, which can be found
      [here](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases).
    - Or using one of these scientific Python distributions:
        1. [Python(x,y)](http://pythonxy.googlecode.com)
        2. [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/)
        3. [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads)

* On Mac OSX:

    - Using our DMG installer, which can be found
      [here](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases).
    - Using the [Anaconda Distribution](http://continuum.io/downloads).
    - Through [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/).
            
* On GNU/Linux

    - Through your distribution package manager (i.e. `apt-get`, `yum`,
    etc).
    - Using the [Anaconda Distribution](http://continuum.io/downloads).
    - Installing from source (see below).

* Cross-platform way from source

You can install Spyder from its zip source package named `spyder-x.y.z.zip`
[here](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases). Then you need to
use standard Python `setup.py` script:

    python setup.py install

Note that `setup.py` is not able to uninstall previous versions
of Python packages: it simply copies files on top of an existing
installation. So the better way is to use `pip` package manager:

    pip install .

Note the `.` at the end of command. `pip` can also install Spyder from
the [Python package index](http://pypi.python.org/pypi) *and* upgrade an
existing installation

    pip install --upgrade spyder

For more details on supported platforms, please go to
<http://pythonhosted.org/spyder/installation.html>.


## Dependencies

*Imnportant note*: Most if not all the dependencies listed below come
with Python(x,y), WinPython and Anaconda, so you don't need to install
them separately when installing one of these scientific Python
distributions.

### Build dependencies

When installing Spyder from its source package (using the command
`python setup.py install`), the only requirements is to have a Python version
greater than 2.6.

### Runtime dependencies

* Python 2.6+

* PyQt4 4.6+ or PySide 1.2.0+ (PyQt4 is recommended)
            
### Recommended modules

* Rope v0.9.2+ (editor code completion, calltips and go-to-definition)

* Pyflakes v0.5.0+ (real-time code analysis)

* Sphinx v0.6+ (object inspector's rich text mode)

* Numpy (N-dimensional arrays)

* Scipy (signal/image processing)

* Matplotlib (2D/3D plotting)

* IPython 1.0+ (enhanced Python interpreter)

    In Ubuntu you need to install `ipython-qtconsole`, on Fedora
    `ipython-gui` and on Gentoo `ipython` with the `qt4` USE flag.

### Optional modules

* Pygments (syntax highlighting for several file types).

* Pylint (static code analysis).

* Pep8 (style analysis).
